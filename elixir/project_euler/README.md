# Project Euler

Project Euler (named after Leonhard Euler) is a website dedicated
to a series of computational problems intended to be solved with
computer programs.

This module attempts to do that with Elixir.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

  1. Add project_euler to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

        def deps do
          [{:project_euler, "~> 0.0.1"}]
        end

  2. Ensure project_euler is started before your application:

        def application do
          [applications: [:project_euler]]
        end
